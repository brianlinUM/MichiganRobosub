Gate Guiding Algorithm
Given camera input, guides the robot to the center of the gate by calculating the heading

To run:
	python robosub.py

To use real-time camera input instead of file input, would have to change how robosub.py gate_centering() function gets its data
i.e. move it into the while loop in video_to_photo

Make sure to suppress image display (cv2.imshow() ) and prints as necessary in robosub.py
Algo only works well when entirety of gate is seen. No object tracking implemented yet.


TODO: object tracking - probably more accurate and faster once gate bars are initially detected

Current algo outline:

pre-processing:
	sharpen image, remove noise, threshold filter orange colors

contour boxing:
	calculate the contours of the orange bars, then create a box representation of each bar

false postive removal:
	assume lowest 3 boxes are valid bars (above ones are false positives/ surface reflections)

target calculation:
	based on box boundaries (corners), calculate the target point (center of right half)
