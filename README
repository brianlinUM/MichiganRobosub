Gate Guiding Algorithm
Given camera input, guides the robot to the center of the gate by calculating the heading

To run:
	python robosub.py

To use real-time camera input instead of file input, would have to change how robosub.py edge_detect function gets its data
i.e. move it into the while loop in video_to_photo

Make sure to suppress image display (cv2.imshow() ) as necessary in line_segments_detect.py
Algo only works well when entirety of gate is seen. No object tracking implemented yet.




Current algo outline:

pre-processing:
	sharpen image, remove noise, then highlight edges

line-segment detection:
	use Hough Lines to consolidate detected edges into line representations

trimming:
	remove or trim lines that are too high (low y-value) to reduce affect of under-surface reflection

clustering:
	cluster line-segments into four parts: horizontal bar (filtered out by angle thresholding), (through k-means):
	two side-bars, and mid bar.

line consolidation:
	create a single line to represent each cluster

heading calculation:
	use single-line representations to calculate heading from frame center.
